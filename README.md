Pipeline for lobe segmentation and lesion volume extraction


The available code was used to analyze the lesion (white matter, leukocortical, cortical) load specific to each lobe (frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital).

At our disposal we had 7 Tesla scans in order to segment the lesions, 3 Tesla scans in order to have a FreeSurfer anatomical scan.
